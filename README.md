## 💡 Inspiration
Grafo - γράφω (gráphō) means “I write” in Greek.
Writing cover letters can be an incredibly tedious task. It requires a lot of time and effort to craft the perfect letter for each job you apply for and research the company’s culture and mission statement. After a while, it can become quite tiresome to write up yet another version of your resume with slight variations in order to make it stand out from other applicants.

However, writing cover letters is essential to land your dream job or even getting noticed by potential employers. A good cover letter should show off your skillset in relation to the position you are applying for and demonstrate why hiring managers should take notice of you over all other candidates who have applied for that same role. If done correctly, this could be one step closer to getting hired! So I made Grafo

## 🖥What it does
Grafo is powered by a generative pre-trained model of cohere-ai to generate the cover letters needed. Users will write their prompts as detailed as possible and the web app will create the response in the best way possible.
